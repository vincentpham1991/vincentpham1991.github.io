## Test Locally

run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. 
This will most likely point to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`.


## Create New Tab in Navigation:

Modify `_data/navigation.yml`. Also add the new folder in main as well as the `index.md`.

## Images

- They should be under the `/images` folder. 
- Images used for each navigation index.md should be ~ 320 x 180.
