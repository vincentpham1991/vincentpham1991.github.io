Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist at Amazon.
I have a MS in Analytics from [The University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/analytics){:target="_blank"} and a BA in Economics from [The University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
Previously, I was a Data Scientist at Capital One, using ML to detect insider threats as well as innovating solutions for the company. 
Other than a direct career in Data Science, I have had experiences in a range of fields varying from ornithology to behavorial economics, as well as a range of topics such as image recognition to natural language processing.
Mainly though, I enjoy playing around with data and finding key insights from the story they tell. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions that I may be able to answer. If you have not seen my [project portfolio](http://vincentpham1991.github.io/projects/) yet, check it out.
