__[TO BE UPDATED]__

I am currently pursuing a master's in analytics at the University of San Francisco while working as a Data Scientist at Capital One. I have had experiences in a range of fields varying from ornithology to behavorial economics, as well as a range of topics such as image recognition to natural language processing. Mainly though, I enjoy playing around with data and finding key insights from the story they tell. 

__I am also on the job market__, so feel free to contact me if you have an opportunity. Or contact me anyways if you have a question I can answer. If you have not seen my [project portfolio](http://vincentpham1991.github.io/projects/) yet, check it out.
