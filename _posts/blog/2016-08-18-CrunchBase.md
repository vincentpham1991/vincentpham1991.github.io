The Data was obtained from [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/){:target="_blank"} ending in October 2013. Data was precollected by /u/bstancil [here](https://github.com/mode/blog/tree/master/2013-10-17%20Seed%20Funding){:target="_blank"}. Raw data were extracted and transformed in PostgreSQL for further fine-tuning.

__Companies Starting Up:__ This shows the number of companies that obtained their first investment aggregated at a monthly level. Windowing option is available to investigate periods of interest. 

__Seed Rounds:__ This plot shows how the correlation between the first and second seed round coded by the current status (as of 2013) of the company. 

__Second Round:__ Since "Seed Rounds" removed all companies that did not have a second round, this plot tells us what that magnitude is.
